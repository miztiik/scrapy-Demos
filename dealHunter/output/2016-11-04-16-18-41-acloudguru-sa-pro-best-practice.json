            "2/\nConsider the transition time line.  Unless they 'just' built the data center, then at least a portion of that equipment will be approaching end of life (end of support/warranty).  It would be unusual to do a big bang pick and shift to a new Data ctr, new hardware, new utilities, and new processes.  Talk about a transition timeline that manages Risk through staff training, testing, piloting through ballooning tinto AWS.  This timeline will both demonstrate Risk management, and answer the question about aging out a lot of the infrastructure.  ", 
            "3/\nthere is a concept in accounting called 'sunk cost'.  Once it is spent it is gone and should not be considered.  Although this does not work on an emotional level, it will work in a financial review.  Basically all the millions they have spent on the Data Ctr is almost irrelevant.  ", 
            "\" What is past is past.  You are at a fork on the road, which one costs less in the mid to long term\".  \nWhat is relevant is the fixed contracts they have in place that have to be paid out whether they use that service or not, and the value of the equipment as scrap or charity.",

            "What operating expense will they have with AWS.  Don't forget the data transfer costs asn that can be very high with a poorly designed solution.  Remember that Auto-scaling could require their code and processes to be restructured so may not be a short or even mid-term benefit.",

            "What labour changes will they have going to AWS, Reskilling costs for all engineering and Mgt staff (A Cloud Guru courses and on site training sessions).  Possibly releasing some staff, possibly hiring new specialists",

            "Big issues that I think are often overlooked include out of the box ITIL process support and compliance documentation.  If the organization has been struggling with demonstrating security compliance or process management, AWS; IAM, logging, reporting, 'Config' , 'Advisor', etc can help deliver better reporting, and so that budget for those business aspects can be brought into the mix.   To be honest There are some organisations I have worked for that spent more on those aspects than on the Infrastructure  They would have looked at AWS just to solve those problems.", 
            "((  I had a vendor come to present us with a new product.  As part of his presentation he passed the CFO a spreadsheet with his costs, and blanks for the CFO to enter our current and expected costs.  He let us do the comparison, and by calling out all the changes to the Infra and 'other' budgets he let us sell it to ourselves.  It did not go ahead because of technical blockers, but financially we got to really understand the Capex / Opex benefits across the wider business ))", 
            "4/\nSpend time learning about your key objectors.  What is their perspective, what are their motivations?  Are they afraid of losing power because their quarter century of IT experience will be redundant?  Are they concerned about AWS ability to deliver, and that they will be embarrassed by a screw up?  Are they motivated by relationships and will be embarrassed by walking away from their current suppliers.  All of these can be addressed. Talk to your senior sales exec about how to research these people and how to manage their concerns/fears. ", 
            "Remember that Snr managers HATE being the least informed person in the room.  Maybe you need to do some free training workshops for the decision makers to cover some of the basics, and workshop some of their current pain points.  \nTalk to AWS Professional services for resources.",
