            "I think the answer is B and C as well.", 
            "Here are my thoughts:", 
            "A: Doesn't make sense of best practice to have \"default allow all rule\".", 
            "B: This question is confusing. IP Address range can also be part of Subnet, and I can have different zones with different IP Address Ranges that are on different Subnets. In this case using NACLs make sense to restrict IP Address Ranges base on needed access.", 
            "C: Make sense because SG acts like a Firewall, and best practice it to have \"implicit deny all\" and only allow what is needed.", 
            "D: The traditional routing restriction are not as efficient compare to using Security Groups and NACLs in the Cloud; where the SG and NACLs are more preferred because of the granular restriction (such as protocols/ports) like a firewall.",

        "You are designing security inside your VPC. You are considering the.options for establishing separate security zones and enforcing network traffic rules across different zone to limit Instances can communications. ", 
        "How would you accomplish these requirements.Choose 2 answers", 
        "A.Configure a security group for every zone. Configure a default allow all rule. Configure explicit deny rules for the zones that shouldn't be able to communicate with one another", 
        "B.Configure you instances to use pre-set P addresses with an IP address range every security zone. Configure  NACL to explicitly allow or deny communication between the different IP address ranges, as required for interzone communication", 
        "C.Configure a security group for every zone. Configure allow rules only between zone that need to be able to communicate with one another. Use implicit deny all rule to block any other traffic", 
        "D.Configure multiple subnets in your VPC, one for each zone. Configure routing within your VPC in such a way that .each subnet only has routes to other subnets with which it needs to communicate, and doesn't have routes to subnets with which it shouldn't be able to communicate."
