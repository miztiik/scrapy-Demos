        "According to the following cloud design pattern, if a web application is multi-device compatible and we need SSL/Sticky sessions for them then we need to implement multiple ELBs to solve this issue. Am wondering why can't we use just 2 ELBs. One for handling SSLs and other for Sticky Sessions ? What's wrong with this approach ? Can someone please clarify.",
