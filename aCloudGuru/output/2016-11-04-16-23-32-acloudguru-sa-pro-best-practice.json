            "the 'hash key' usage in these answers is curious. are they referring to a secondary index? if so, that seems like an egregious oversight. i can't tell if the answers are straightforward or poorly worded :)", 
            "i'm going to assume things are straightforward (i.e. providing the required information to answer the question without unnecessary inference)..", 
            "in the dynamodb data model, \"primary keys\" take two shapes:", 
            "1. a simple primary key, consisting of one attribute: the partition key. the partition key had been historically referred to as the 'hash key' (as it uses an internal hash function to determine the proper storage location).", 
            "2. a composite primary key, consisting of two attributes: the partition key and the 'sort key'. the sort key had been historically referred to as the 'range key'. the 'sort key' is the reference by which items with the same partition key are sorted.", 
            "name changes aside, i believe we can use that information to eliminate the first two answers straight away: they do not adhere to our data model.", 
            "the question asks about performance and management (deletion). unfortunately, we have no real information about how the queries will be performed (e.g. how often are things requested? are all items requested equally? etc).", 
            "disregarding the potential request profile, concatenating the sensor ID and timestamp should give us enough randomness for a fairly even write distribution across partitions.", 
            "in regards to management: if all items were in one table, with only the simple primary key to work with, to delete specific entities, one would have to first query the table and return the appropriate items. once known, those items could then be deleted. however, as we know our business logic dictates that deletion happens in weekly blocks, placing the items in tables organized by week provides the benefit of removal by simply dropping the entire table(s).", 
            "all that said, my answer would be C."

            "Especially this section below from above doc link, seems to hold a strong clue. So the answer will be one that has a primary key which is a concatenation of the sensor ID and timestamp. Since this will randomize it well enough for uniform distribution across various partitions.", 
            "Note", 
            "DynamoDB is optimized for uniform distribution of items across a table's partitions, no matter how many partitions there may be. We recommend that you choose a partition key that can have a large number of distinct values relative to the number of items in the table.
