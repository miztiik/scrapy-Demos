        "I passed both the SA Extended and the Developer course today, both with an 85%. Both courses were great for preparing. Would definitely recommended following along with the examples and doing them yourself, and at least doing a quick read of the the White Papers linked. Very happy with the course and some of the questions on the test were almost exactly the questions in the various exams in the course.", "By taking both exams in the same day you really see the overlap. About 10-15 questions were either exactly the same or extremely similar between the 2 tests, which is either good or bad depending on if you remember those questions :). I took the complete Developer course and only needed to do 50% of this course because of the overlap.", "For the extended exam it seems they added questions on Kinesis, ECS (containers), Lambda (2-3 questions), EMR (in the context of being able to control the EC2 instance it creates). Not sure what else was on there that isn't on the non-extended.", "Thank you Ryan and the A Cloud Guru team!"

In an attempt to maximize performance between the accounts, you place all the instances for these accounts in 'eu-west-1b'. During testing, you find almost no transfer latency between accounts A and B, but significant latency between accounts B and C, and accounts C and A. Which of the following possibilities is the most likely source of the problem?", "1) The names of the AZs are randomly applied, so 'eu-west-1b' is not the same location for all three accounts.", "2)You have incorrectly configured the cross account authentication policies in account C adding latency to those instances.", "3) Account C has been allocated to an older section of the Data Hall with slower networking.", "4) The instances for account C are on an overloaded Host. Stop all the Account C instances and then start them together so that they run an a new host.", "And the correct answer is 1) the explanation is : \"The Availability Zone names presented are unique per account and do not represent a specific set of physical resources.\"  ", "I don't understand the thing about the names of the AZs.  Maybe it's just weird for me. But what I can understand is that even if I choose the same AZ for all the accounts, the physical servers where the instances run, cannot be the same."

They then apply these updates and reboot: if the software has not downloaded within half an hour, then the update will attempt to download the following day. You notice that a number of EC2 instances are continually failing to download the updates in the allotted time.

You are not told in this question whether the proxy server is in a public or private subnet, so if it is in a public subnet, the the proxy server instance size itself is not large enough to cope with the current network throughput. If the proxy server is in a private subnet, then it must be using a NAT gateway in which to communicate out to the internet. This NAT gateway may also be inadequately provisioned in terms of size.

There are so many things called platform including web, Application, Database, data integration, even AWS is called 'comprenshensive platform'.

        "So I took Ryan's amazing, very easy to follow course. I also purchased the bundle of 7 practice exams from WhizLabs and took each of them at least 3 times until I was scoring in the high 90s. I definitely saw some questions taken directly (almost word for word) from the WhizLabs tests on my official exam. Thirdly, I purchased the official AWS SA Study Guide from Amazon for $60 and read in front to back and then went back to the topics I was having a tough time grasping such as EMR, etc. Not too many surprises when I sat the exam except for at least 3 questions on ECS (not covered in this course) and some DB questions that threw me for a little bit of a loop. I ended up marking 33 questions for review and then went back and took extra time on those. ACloudGuru is awesome and has really lit a fire under me to get the other 2 Associate Level Certs and then go for the Professional ones. Thanks again Ryan and Team, if anyone has any questions please feel free to ask!"

It has summaries and labs at the end of the chapters along with testing. I like the videos and am still getting used to learning that way. For me, having written info really helps enforce the video learning. If I had done the labs, pretty sure they would have helped.", "As for surprises - there was nothing from the services that has not been updated in the videos from acloud.guru. High level Kinesis, Opsworks, API Gateway, Lambda and ECS are good to know.  Not super detailed but you have to know how they function.  Reasons for using VPC Flow Logs and for CloudTrail. A lot of little things like knowing which services are across zones or how to move stuff from one zone to another or across regions. These are tricky. Understanding EBS and encryption is important and how you would move a volume. It seemed like NATs and bastion info is more important than I would have thought.  But they use these to test your security knowledge along with VPC knowledge. Of course, VPC is critical along with EC2 and S3. Security is woven throughout and understanding the main security on VPC, EC2, and S3 was good. There is the usual reserved, spot, on-demand instance knowledge you must have along with good cloud architecture practice.", "I have been doing AWS work for over 2 years and admittedly did study a bit for this and wanted to get above 90. I did buy a practice exam and got 85%. I did all the exams on the video sections but when I went to take the mini exam at the end\u2026. I got 47%. Freaked me out but I was within the 72 hour test taking window so I did not reschedule. I did NOT take the final exam on the acloud.guru course because I did not want to freak out more.  In the end... I cannot explain the discrepancy in the mini exam vs the real test.  It was only 2 days apart from those tests.  The amount of material is just very large in scope and it must have been a sample on items I for which I was not prepared.", "Thanks again acloud.guru for all the good videos.
