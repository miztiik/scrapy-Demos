The related parts of my setup is this: An auto-scaling ElasticBeanstalk environment running c4.xlarge instances that scales between 16 to 30 instances over the day An EC2 server running a m3.xlarge MySQL database (not RDS) All the instances in the Beanstalk environment are running in the same VPC and private subnet as the database server. Occasionally an instance that's launched as the Beanstalk environment scales up will have 100\\% packet loss to the database. When this happens it's particular to that instance, i.e. it's not generally affecting other instances in the Beanstalk environment that have the exact same configuration. Sometimes the issue will seem to magically resolve itself after some period of time. tcpdump and flow logs seem to indicate that the packets from the affected Beanstalk instance reach the database fine, but no traffic in the other direction from the database to the affected Beanstalk instance (i.e. no entries on the flow logs for the interfaces of either instance showing traffic in that direction, and tcpdump shows nothing received on the Beatstalk instance side). netstat on the database server shows the TCP connections to the Beanstalk instance stuck in SYN_RECV state. When this occurs it affects all traffic between these instances as far as I can tell, not just the intended MySQL traffic (e.g. also SSH, ICMP). I have other databases and resources that are used by the Beanstalk environment, also running on EC2 that don't experience this issue, i.e. traffic to/from the Beanstalk instances to these other databases has never been affected in the same way. Things I have looked at: Security Groups - The relevant traffic is allowed by the configured security group, and the Security group configuration is shared by all the other Beanstalk instances that are otherwise working normally. I even tried temporarily allowing all traffic on both sides to no affect. Network ACLs - I do have few rules that limit access from other subnets, but these instances are on the same private subnet and there is nothing unique that should affect one particular instance at a time in this way. iptables - The iptables on both sides accept all traffic. The only rules on either side are forwarding rules on the Beanstalk instances for the internal Docker containers that are installed as part of the Beanstalk Docker platform. And again, the configuration is shared by the whole environment so it shouldn't uniquely affect one instance. I thought perhaps there was something peculiar under the covers in the AWS routing with this particular database EC2 instance, so I moved this database to a new instance, but the issue persists between the Beanstalk instances and this replacement EC2 instance. Any ideas of what I might try next? If anyone from Amazon happens to read this the database is instance i-05089ef620d98a507 and the Beanstalk environment is e-ph4cijyzpw.

When you associate an Elastic IP address with an instance that previously had a public IPv4 address, the public DNS hostname of the instance changes to match the Elastic IP address [1].

When you launch an instance into a default VPC, we provide the instance with public and private DNS hostnames that correspond to the public IPv4 and private IPv4 addresses for the instance. When you launch an instance into a nondefault VPC, we provide the instance with a private DNS hostname and we might provide a public DNS hostname, depending on the settings you specify for the VPC and for the instance.

Copied below ***** Hello, Thank you for contacting AWS support! My name is Justin and I will be assisting you today. I apologize for the trouble with performance you have been having with your EBS volumes. I have taken a look at the instance provided and see that you are using GP2 volume types. GP2 EBS Volumes use a credit system for their I/O, and it looks like you are running out of credits for the burst IOPS for your volume. The calculation for baseline performance is 3*(size of volume). For the case of the boot volume of your instance, that volume has a baseline of 450 IOPS. Once a volume runs out of burst credits, that volume will fall back to the baseline performance. You can see this listed in the graph below. https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home?region=us-west-1#metrics:graph=!NS0!MN1!ST2!ET3!SS4!PD5!D06!E07!VAAWS/EBS~BurstBalance~2017-01-30T04%3A43%3A55Z~2017-02-10T04%3A36%3A25Z~Average~3600~VolumeId~vol-533405fd As you can see, your instance seems to run well enough until it reaches points that it needs to burst. Once it starts bursting, the instance almost immediately uses up all of its burst credits. Then, once that period of activity is done, it slowly ramps back up (over a period of 4 to 5 hours) until your credit balance is full. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSVolumeTypes.html As of right now, I can see two options for you to mitigate this issue. For one, you could simply create a new, larger, GP2 volume. Since GP2 volumes are given IOPS based on 3*(size of disk), a larger GP2 volume would give you more IOPS for your baseline. For example, a 500GB volume would give you a baseline of 1,500 IOPS, as opposed to the 450 IOPS you are currently seeing. It would also refill your credits for bursting much faster than your 150GB would. Please note that any drives 1TB and larger do not need burst credits, as their burst maximum and baseline are the same. Another possibility would be to look into Provisioned IOPS SSD volumes. Provisioned IOPS can provide you with sustained storage over a period of time without having to worry about burst credits. However, they are a bit more expensive. https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/pricing/ Please note that to do any of these, you would need to create a snapshot, and then restore a volume from that snapshot. During that process, you will be able to select what kind of volume you would like to create, as well as the size of said volume. You can then attach that newly created volume as the boot volume for the instance that was having the issue. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-restoring-volume.html Let me know if you need more information or clarification on any of these, or if you have any further questions.

Is that right? \u2014>Can anyone assure me that this will match up with my live instance when my current RI expires tomorrow ? Yes, with your current setup the discount should continue to apply but there are some caveats. With recent changes to Reserved Instance, (RI) it comes in two different flavors namely Standard RI and Convertible RI. The AWS blog post [1] has more concise information related to RI and available features. Standard Reserved Instances [2] can be purchased to apply to instances in a specific Availability Zone, or to instances in a region. [2] I checked your account and I can see the RI you have purchase is Standard RI with regional benefit and the AZ is empty. When you purchase RI with Regional benefit, the discount will be applied to any instances within the region and the RI discount is not constrained to a particular AZ. (eu-west-1a) While the discount is applied to all instance within the region, you however lose the ability to make capacity reservation. On the other hand, when you purchase RI with AZ benefit, the discount is only applied to instance running on the AZ specified but RI with specific AZ provides Capacity reservation. Capacity Reservation guarantees that you will have an option to start an instance within the AZ you have purchase RI. (AZ specific) [3] This is beneficial if you have a need to reserve capacity on a particular AZ. (eu-west-1a) The good news is, it is entirely possible to modify Standard Reserved [4] Instances purchased for a specific Availability Zone to a region\u2014but doing so removes the associated capacity reservation. I hope the information helps minimize your concerns.

I did manage to stop the instance (it required a force stop) and was able to start it again. At that point it was reachable and functioning normally - and still is.

For example, ami-5e63d13e in us-west-2 shows these block devices: /dev/sda1=snap-0525e650246827d18:8:true:gp2, /dev/sdb=ephemeral0, /dev/sdc=ephemeral1 When creating new AMIs from this base AMI using either Packer or knife-ec2, that metadata was preserved in the new AMIs, even when using an instance type that does not support ephemeral drives. When creating new AMIs from this base AMI in the console for an m4 or c4 instance type, that metadata is removed. So it appears that any process that uses the AWS APIs improperly preserves the ephemeral block device metadata, even for instance types where those devices are not supported.
