The function calls a select statement that runs perfectly on the local machine but throws an internal server 500 error on EC2 when I call the function from the browser. The statements on the local machine and EC2 were identical. I have simplified the statement on the EC2 server to 'Select - FROM t_ddxshort' but I still get the error when it is executed. I have debugged the function and only get errors when the Select statement is executed. This works: public function gett_ddxicd10specific() { $stmt = mysqli_prepare($this->connection, 'SELECT - FROM t_ddxshort'); echo('works'); echo('okay'); mysqli_stmt_free_result($stmt); mysqli_close($this->connection); } and returns this: worksokay This does not work: public function gett_ddxicd10specific() { $stmt = mysqli_prepare($this->connection, 'SELECT - FROM t_ddxshort'); echo('works'); mysqli_stmt_execute($stmt); $this->throwExceptionOnError(); echo('okay'); mysqli_stmt_free_result($stmt); mysqli_close($this->connection); } and returns this 500 Internal Server Error works The local table and the RDS table (t_ddxshort) are identical down to the encoding and collation. Both tables have two columns 'idt_ddxshort' and 'diagnosis'. I use SequelPro for managing my databases and the query works perfectly in SequelPro for local and RDS. The syntax is correct and simple. All my other classes and functions in my application work fine and all other queries execute without error. The connection for all classes is 'include connection.php' and is included at the start of the class. I have deleted the file and recreated the file. I have created a file will another name twice. I can't understand why this one query will not work on EC2/RDS.
